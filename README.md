### Additional Libraries
- Firebase User Authentication
- React-Toastify

### Issues and Resolutions:

- Error: CORS preventing audio from SoundCloud link from playing
    -  Resolution: You can retrieve the link by searching the song you want on SoundClound, select share, and then embed. Take the src link to be able to play the song.

- Error: Cannot retrieve user data
    - Resolution: Used the spread operator

- Error: Authentication state persistance - when logout button is clicked, there is still a call to the backend to get user data
    - Resolution: added a loggingIn state which changes from 'log in' or 'register' to false based on clicking the login/register button

### Future Plans:
- Include a recently played section on the homepage
- Include a recommend or "Discover" section which displays songs with a similar genre
- Track listening statistics including how long users listen to songs and how many times they listen to artists and individual song - similar to spotify wrapped.
